Description: Given a list of files in multiple directories, this package allows you to
  identify specific files by regex. The package also supports parsing specific parts of
  the filename into discrete fields. The filefinder package was built to support a very
  specific use case of extracting a group of files with similar (not identical) filenames
  from a very large index of files. The value beyond this use case is not apparent yet.
